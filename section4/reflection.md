## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
It felt a bit more focused and task oriented. I was better able to keep track of my progress, and break down the work into manageable chunks.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I set intentions before each section of work I did. I just wasn't always able to complete the task I set. I need to work on setting realistic times/goals for each section.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is a way to store more detailed or complicated data. It's similar to an array, but you can organize the data and manipulate the data more easily.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - An array would be fine, it's all the same data, and you could use array methods to add or subtract/manipulate the data points.
  * List of states and their capitals- An array would also work here. States with their capitals would also be a simple list in string form, which an array is sufficient to manage.
  * List of things to pack for vacation - An object would be better in this case. That way you can break down each item, add the specific information about the item/s you need, and add/manipulate quantities.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - An array again would be fine for this, if its simply a list of IG user account names.
  * List of student names and their cohort - An array would work here as well, as you can list students and their cohort as a string, and this is all the same type of data.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - An object would be the most appropriate method here. That will make it much easier to specify ingredients, what kind of ingredient, how much of each ingredient, etc. More complicated data set.
  * All my favorite restaurants - An array would be sufficient for this, since it is again, just a list of string data.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
I use AXS to purchase and manage my concert tickets. That application stores tons of data. In the case of my specific upcoming shows, it could use an object to store the information and display it to me in the app. The object could be named something like 'UpcomingShows'. Keys could be things like 'artist name', 'venue name', 'ticket number', 'date of show', 'time of show', and values could be 'Sylvan Esso', 'Mission Ballroom', '2', '091421', '2000'.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I definitely need more practice and information about methods in classes. I struggled with the tweet.js activity!
