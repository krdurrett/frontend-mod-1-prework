## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  The SuperLearner article made a lot of sense. Many of the habits are ones that successful people in general do!  I already have a growth mindset, I am consistently atttempting to learn and grow in all areas of my life. It takes a lot of work but it's worth it! I take care of my brain, by getting lots of sleep and eating pretty well. I am approaching 40 and want to make sure I stay ahead of the curve, so to speak, health-wise. I take lots of breaks when I study/work/learn. Mostly because I can't stare at a screen for too long, but also because I just want to move my body and reset my focus. I would absolutely love to read more. I used to read much more, but adult life got away from me and I haven't prioritized it. Now that i'm going back to school, this is the perfect time to reeastablish the habit! Also, teaching is something I dont have a ton of experience with. I know it would really help me solidify the ideas i'm learning. I already have done a bit of that for my cohort-mates who were struggling with some concepts in Mod0. The only thing I can think to add is just to keep an open mind and dont be too hard on yourself. There will always be challenges with learning, but if you can take a step back and breathe, there's almost always a solution.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  I learned about three data types: String, Number, and Boolean. A string is just a group of characters (could be letters, numbers, other characters). Be sure to wrap a string with quotes, this will indicate it is a string. A number is fairly self explanitory, it's all numbers. It can include a negative number or decimal. Be sure not to use commas in longer numbers. Numbers are not wrapped in quotes. A Boolean compares or evaluates two values, and gives either a true or false output.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
  console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  You would use two backslashes // for a single line comment, or you can use /* for a multi-line comment */ (wrap the comment in a backslash and asterisk). A code comment is helpful to explain intention or reasoning for your code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  A variable is a way to keep data that can then be changed later on. Explaining it to a five year old: a variable is like putting your legos in a special storage box. We can always go back to that box and change the legos to something else, but the box stays there labeled with what's in it: Legos!

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
  I use Spotify nearly everyday. The app uses string variables when I search for an artist or a song, and it returns a list of options that match what I type. It also holds information of what kind of music I listen to to create a curated playlist, using string data and probably Boolean data (does this customer want Pink Floyd on their playlist?-TRUE). It also must calculate timing of songs/playlists using number data.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
  Concatenation simply means linking things together. To unite in a series.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
  I use Facebook daily. There are so many data points at play on this app. I believe concatention is used when tagging posted photos (linking a photo with a user). It may be used when 'checking in' at an event or a place (linking a post with a location). It's probably used with ads as well, when we post or even speak about a thing, and then an ad for said thing pops up (linking a input data point from user with an advertisment from a sponsored partner).

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  I was wondering about git push vs. git push to origin main. Honestly, most of the questions I have come up in relation to git/GitHub. This is still such a new concept, I think I need to practice it more!
