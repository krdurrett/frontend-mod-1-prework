## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
Having a growth mindset is a lot like being willing to admit you don't know everything! It's all about recognizing there is so much to learn, and we all never stop growing and learning. You don't know what you don't know!

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I have been embracing a growth mindset for years, by admitting I have a lot to learn about everything. I am very open to criticism. I am not the best at seeking out help when I need it. This comes down to pride!

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
I use my weather app daily. I think they most use arrays when storing hourly/daily temps. Temperatures are values that are all related, and there could be flexibility in that storage. Does it store temps by the hour? By the day? An array would allow the developer of the app to store temperature points, and the recall them however the user would like the information to be displayed.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
Array methods are ways to access or manipulate elements in an array. There are many different array methods, each serving a different purpose. You can add or take away from an array using methods, you can organize or reorder an array using methods.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
Loops check a condition. If the condition returns 'true', a block of code will run. This repeats until the condition in the loop returns false. There are several different types of loops. A 'for' loop would be used to tell how many times to run the loop, like a counter. You can use this kind of loop without an array to log a statement to a console a certain number of times (however you set up the 'for' loop). The statement could be a string or a list of integers. You can use a loop with an array if you like to run code for each item in the array. IE, if you had a list of integers that you'd like to evaluate or recalculate in some way, you create the array and then evaluate the array using a loop.    

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
When we have a messy playroom filled with our toys, how to we decide when it's clean? We need to put our toys away, right?
We'd pick up each toy; and for each toy, we'd put it in it's right place. We would repeat this until each toy has been put away, like a loop! When there are no more toys on the floor, we are done repeating this task, and the room is clean!

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I would like to learn more about the different types of loops, I believe that would give me more clarification on the syntax. I am unclear about i++ and i-- (increment and decrement) and their application, particularly if we are incrementing by more than one. I need much more practice with array methods. I understand the basic syntax, but I need more exposure to them to understand them better.
