//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
var numAnimals;
numAnimals = animals.length
console.log(numAnimals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
//var animals = new Array ("Zebra", "Giraffe", "Gorilla");
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Penguin");
console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
//**YOU WOULD HAVE TO BLOCK OUT THE PREVIOUS CODE OF 'new Array' TO GO BACK TO ORIGINAL 'animals' array
console.log(animals[2]);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["pizza", "tacos", "donuts", "sushi"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
var numFoods = foods.length
console.log(numFoods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push("broccoli");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push("apples", "cookies", "pickles");
console.log(foods);


// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
console.log(foods);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: I use Spotify a ton. In daily playlists compiled by Spotify, they would keep a list (array) of related songs to play.
// 2: I use my weather app. They would store the tempurature, wind, sunrise/sunset, precipitation, etc as an array to pop up based on my area.
// 3: I use Amazon fairly regularaly. They would store my recently ordered items in an array.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
//The user can call an Uber if they have 15% or more battery life, regardless of whether
//or not they have a charger or what type it is.
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  //If their battery percentage is greater than 15% the console would log that they can call an Uber.
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
}
//If the user has less than 15% battery life, but has a car charger, they can still call an Uber.
//Determine this using the '&&' conditional.
else if ((percentBatteryLeft < 15) && (hasCharger && true) && (chargerType === "car")) {
//If the user has the car charger with less than 15%, the console would log that they can call an Uber.
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
}
//If the user has less than 15% battery life, has no charger, OR their charger isn't a car charger
//then they will be unable to call an Uber. Determine this using the '||' conditional.
else if ((percentBatteryLeft < 15) || (hasCharger && true) || (chargerType !== "car")) {
//If the user doesnt have enough battery life, nor a car charger, the console would log that they
//cannot call an Uber.
  console.log("You cannot call an Uber!");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
